Main purpose of this project if to figure out if a correlation exists between the different attributes that are in the dataset and explore different visual representations.

This notebook study was originally inspired by a Kaggle task for the dataset Students Performance in Exams:

To add a little mystery in this notebook the PPS package is also tested. The PPS describes itself as an alternative to the correlation able to find more patterns in the data. I heard about this package in the following blog:
